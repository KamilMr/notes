# Notes

## About repo

This space serves as my personal notes repository. It's a bit disorganized currently, but I'm gradually bringing more structure to it. My primary focus is on JavaScript and Google Cloud, so currently, I am mainly concentrating on two files: javascript.md and cloudDeveloper.md.

## Future

By compiling these notes, I aim to create a centralized resource for referencing things I've learned previously, as well as to deepen my understanding. In the future, I plan to develop a project that integrates these notes with a Neovim plugin, allowing for quick and easy access.
